##### Key Stakeholders:

+ Urška Sršen — Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer

+ Bellabeat marketing analytics team — A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

##### Prepare:

##### Gathering Data
Data that will be collected and used the is **FitBit Fitness Tracker** data gotten from Kaggle. These 18 data sets
contain personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes
information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

Considering that bellabeat creates products for women only, the data collected has limitations such as a small sample size of thirty participants. The key factors as well are limited and missing values like age, gender, location and lifestyle choices.

The datasets that will be used for Analysis are Daily activity, daily calories, daily intensities, daily steps, sleep and weight.

Rstudio is also used to perform this analysis due to the numerous datasets being used and for simplicity

##### Installing and Loading Packages

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("readr")

library(tidyverse)  
library(dplyr)  
library(janitor)  
library(readr)  
```

##### Importing Datasets

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/bellabeat data")
daily_calories <- read_csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv")
daily_activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")  
daily_intensities <- read_csv("dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
daily_steps <- read_csv("dailySteps_merged.csv")
sleep_day <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight <- read_csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```

#### Analysis

##### View Datasets
The head, glimpse and colnames function are used to clean and explore the dataset.

Activity

```{r}
head(daily_activity)
glimpse(daily_activity)
colnames(daily_activity)
```
Intensities
```{r}
head(daily_intensities)
glimpse(daily_intensities)
colnames(daily_intensities)
```

Steps
```{r}
head(daily_steps)  
glimpse(daily_steps)
colnames(daily_steps)
```

Calories
```{r}
head(daily_calories)
glimpse(daily_calories)
colnames(daily_calories)
```

Sleep
```{r}
head(sleep_day)
glimpse(sleep_day)
colnames(sleep_day)
```

Weight
```{r}
head(weight)
glimpse(weight)
colnames(weight)
```

##### Remove datasets :

A unique Identifier between the datasets daily_activity, daily_calories, daily_intensities, daily_steps, sleep and weight is the Id. Using the function glimpse and column names, it is observed that daily_activity contains columns found in daily_steps, daily_intensities, daily_calories and the same number of rows which is 940 observations. From this obeservation, we will remove the datasets already contained in daily_activity. For the Analysis, daily_activity, Sleep and Weight datasets will be used.

Using this Identifier, the n_distinct function will be used to get exact values and how many participants are in the dataset.

```{r}
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
n_distinct(sleep_day$Id)
n_distinct(weight$Id)
```
the n_distinct result shows sample sizes quite small to be able make a reliable conclusion or recommendation for Bellabeat, more data will need to be analyzed.

#### Analysis :

###### Activity
```{r}
summary(daily_activity)
```

The activity dataset shows that the mean of very active minutes is 21.16 which is way less than sedentary minutes which is 991.2, although the dataset is limited, this shows that participants are not being proactive in staying active despite wearing the smart watch device. 
The mean calories is 2304 which is an ideal amount of calories to be burned daily. A woman typically burns between 1800 - 2400 calories without an active lifestyle. At least 3000 calories is needed to lose 1 pound for weight loss. The mean shows that most participants have a sedentary lifestyle, possibly working at a desk and not active.
Mean total steps is 7638. The range of steps between a sedentary lifestyle and an active lifestyle is 5000 - more than 10000 steps, so the mean total steps shows that users have a fairly active lifestyle.

###### Sleep 
```{r}
summary(sleep_day)
```
The maximum value of total sleep records is 3

###### Weight
```{r}
summary(weight)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=daily_activity , aes(x=SedentaryMinutes, y=Calories)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method =lm) + labs(title="Relationship between Sedentary minutes and daily calories burned",caption="The number of Calories needed to lose one pound is 3000")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=daily_activity, aes(x=Calories, y=TotalDistance)) + geom_point(color = 'red') + stat_smooth() + labs(title="Relationship between Total Distance travelled and daily calories burned",caption="The number of Calories needed to lose one pound is 3000")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data= sleep_day, aes(x=TotalTimeInBed, y=TotalMinutesAsleep)) + geom_point(color = 'red') + stat_smooth() + labs(title="Total Time in Bed and Total Minutes asleep")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=weight, aes(x=WeightKg, y=BMI)) + geom_point(color = 'red') + stat_smooth() + labs(title="Relationship between Weight in Kg and BMI",caption="The number of Calories needed to lose one pound is 3000")
```
The Dataset has a really small sample size and is not able to give good predictions for what trends exist in smart device usage seeing as there werent enough participants logging in their activity info consistently.

##### Recommendations

- Bellabeat can endeavour to make its app very engaging for the consumer like having feautures that allows friends to interact with each other within the app
-Have deals for its Bellabeat Membership where there could be promotion deals that encourage consumers inviting friends and family
-Have a good social media presence to get more awareness on what bellebeat is about and products they carry. 
-Consumers need to see the need and effectual change having a smart watch device can add to their lives, having giveaways or promotional value to get consumers invested in giving their testimonials is beneficial.
